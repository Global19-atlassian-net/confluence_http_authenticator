<!-- note: Authenticators cannot be v2 plugins and should be loaded via classpath per CONF-22266.
     We should probably remove this file, although if people are careful, maybe it would work.
     Have setter injection supported in RemoteUserAuthenticator, and you could load via Plugins
     in admin area of Confluence. But, it would have to be tested and isn't suggested. It was
     asked for in a few reviews of the plugin, even though you'd still have to make manual
     seraph config changes and restart Confluence, so it doesn't make things any easier. -->
